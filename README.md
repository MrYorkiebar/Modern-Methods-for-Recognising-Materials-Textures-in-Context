# Modern-Methods-for-Recognising-Materials-Textures-in-Context
This is the code for my Computer Science Research Project (ECMM453) completed as part of my master's degree.

## Abstract of paper
Robotics is a growing field that aims to make humans lives better in various ways. One aspect critical for robotics and automation is the ability to interpret the surrounding environment, including materials & textures. 

In this paper, we evaluate modern architectures and explore alternative training procedures for the task of material and texture recognition. We show that models created from newer CNN architectures demonstrate improved accuracy and training speed while also decreasing the need for bespoke encoding layers found in previous methods. Using newer methods, the same or better accuracy can be achieved with minimal fine-tuning and training data augmentations.

Here are the weights for the best performing epoch for each model trained. It is around 1.71GB total but indiviudal weights can be downloaded.
